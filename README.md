The aims is drive standard population genetic analyses using pangenomic data models. Typically represented in the Graphical Fragment Assembly (GFA) format, these models can represent whole genome alignments in a compact graphical structure. 

Thus far, I have focused on algorithms for bubble detection that allow us to generate Variant Call Format(VCF) files from graphs.
