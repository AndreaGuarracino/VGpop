# VGpop

The aim is drive standard population genetic analyses using pangenomic data models.Typically represented in the Graphical Fragment Assembly (GFA) format, these models can represent whole genome alignments in a compact graphical structure. 

**I have focused on algorithms for bubble detection that allow us to generate Variant Call Format (VCF) files from graphs**.

I use this projection to drive standard population genetic analyzes, and as a mechanism to validation results that I obtain from pangenome graph based population genetic analyzes which I am designing.
